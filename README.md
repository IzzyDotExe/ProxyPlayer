# Welcome to ProxyPlayer!
### The Context...
Despite being an 11 year old game, Minecraft: Java Edition can sometimes be demanding. This is because when you play singleplayer, it simultaneously runs the Minecraft Client and the Minecraft server. Chunk generation, game logic, and more are all handled by the server, the client is actually quite light when it comes to CPU usage. 

So, what if there was a way to offload that huge part of the work when running minecraft to another computer? ProxyPlayer lets you do just that. And even better, you can run any type of server you want with it. Spigot, vanilla, forge, you name it! Proxyplayer works just like singleplayer, but instead of connecting to the localhost server, you can set it up to run anywhere!

Proxyplayer allows you to set up different instances of servers and move your worlds throughout all of them. And the best part is, proxyplayer is opensource and free to use.

### How does it work?
ProxyPlayer is basically a server that manages servers. You will simply import your worlds into a folder and proxyplayer will take care of the rest. It will automatically set up servers and move your worlds into them. All you need to do is run the ProxyPlayer server and install the ProxyPlayer fabric client mod. 

### Why would i want to use this?
You want to use this if you have hardware that isnt powerful enough to run the server and the Minecraft client at the same time. But you do have something which can easily run the server. The prime example for this is if you're using QuestCraft or PojavLauncher on your android phone. You will see massive leaps in performance by using ProxyPlayer. If you simply have another computer lying around doing nothing, Proxyplayer is perfect to put it to use.

### So, what now?
Now you wait, ProxyPlayer is still in its early development stages, but things are coming along well. Stay tuned for the first alpha builds of the proxyplayer server.
